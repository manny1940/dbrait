    <h2>Computer Science and Engineering</h2>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The Department of Computer Engineering was started in the year 1997 with the Post Diploma in Computer Applications Programme and 
       subsequently Diploma in Computer Engineering was started in 1998. Seeing the demand and scope of Computer Application, Diploma in
       Information Technology has also been added in the year 2003.

       The department with the passage of its evolution and growth has succeeded in creating its place by producing quality products that
       are at par with their mainland counterparts. The Computer Science Engineering Department offers courses leading to Diploma in Computer 
       Engineering, Diploma in Information Technology. The department has taken a leap with the commencement of B.Tech Programme in Computer 
       Science & Engineering from the year 2009. All the programmes have been approved by AICTE.
    
       The Department of Computer Science & Engineering offers two Diploma Programs and one Degree Program. This department is also a resource 
       center for Software development and Hardware maintenance for Andaman and Nicobar Administration. This Department offers three courses :

                <p>This laboratory provides computing facility for the students of the department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology. 
                   It consists of more than 18 high end PCs running Microsoft Windows XP as well as Linux (Red Hat) with dual boot option on top of 
                   Intel Pentium IV processor & matching supporting hardware & peripherals and all wired together by the laboratory 100 mbps LAN. 
                   To top it, there are two dual processors Windows server running Windows 2000, with the latest add-ons, an Intel Xeona a generic 
                   Microsoft Windows NT version 4 servers, one on which is an NT terminal server powering the laboratory. Besides these, there is a 
                   local mirror server for Win NT and Win 2000 server to provide the most recent updates to the DBRAIT Port Blair community. Above all, 
                   future plan is to set up a high and server running Sun Solaris to be able for high end computational needs of the student's faculty of 
                   DBRAIT, Port Blair.
