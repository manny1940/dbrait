    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The Maritime Wing is presently conducting three Directorate General (DG) of Shipping approved Pre Sea courses which are:
        <ul>
            <li>2 Year Pre Sea Training for Diploma Engineers or otherwise known as Post Diploma in Marine Engineering (PDME).</li>
            <li>1 Year Diploma in Nautical Science(DNS) leading to B Sc (Nautical Science) course.</li>
            <li>6 Months Pre Sea Training for GP Ratings.</li>
        </ul>
        All the courses are competency based structured training involving the development of both knowledge and skill. All the courses are 
        residential and also involve scheduled co-curricular activities such as parade, PT, games, literary activities, swimming that are required 
        for the overall development of the cadets. The training is based on the tasks framed in the TAR book and Training Manual published on behalf 
        of DG Shipping and the cadets are assessed in accordance with the competency requirement. The period of training requirement for each 
        competency has been stipulated by DG Shipping. Further the DNS course is affiliated to the Indian Maritime University which does all the 
        academic activity viz. framing of course outline, curriculum, conduct of exams, assessment to the award of Diploma/Degree which is also 
        awarded by the University. The Cadets are treated as Officers on Training and they have to be in the prescribed uniform, well-disciplined 
        and behaved and have to follow the rules laid down by the DG Shipping for Maritime Training. Special emphasis is also given towards improving 
        their communication skill by way of conducting seminars, debates, report writing etc. The exams for the Pre Sea Training for GP Ratings are 
        conducted in Port Blair and they have an option of joining the NCV cadet scheme and become an NCV officer instead of joining ship as a seaman.
